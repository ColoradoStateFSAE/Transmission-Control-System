# Transmission control system
An electronic shifting solenoid and servo clutch driver system developed by CSU's formula SAE team!

This system is designed to operate both the shifting and clutch actuation of a motorcycle engine using an electronic solenoid and a 1/5th scale RC servo.
It features auto clutch for downshifts and upshifts eliminating the need for driver controlled clutch actuation during shifting. 
It also supports spark cut for flat shifting above a defined minimum engine RPM allowing for currently tested upshift times of less than 50ms!!!
Lower times are possible but are currently untested, and are likely limited by the transmission itself rather than the hardware.


This system was taken to comp on CSU's car in 2024 and preformed flawlessly.


Uses existing pingle or kliktronic solenoids and replaces existing shifting electronics.
